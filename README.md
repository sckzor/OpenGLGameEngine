# OpenGLGameEngine
A small OpenGL/Java based Game Engine I have been working on.

Functionality includes the ability to:
- Load height map png files for terrain generation
- Use a (built in) perlin noise generator for terrain generation
- Load wavefront .obj files for 3D entities
- Add a special player class with event handler and movement etc.
- Cast rays from the mouse for in game selections
- Render menus and text (both dynamically able to be updated) to the scree
- Render semi realistic water to the screen
- Add screen "bloom" to entities
- Add normal  maps to entities
- Create skyboxes
- Add reflectivity to entites
- Create particle systems
- Add post processing effects
- Render semi realistic shadows to the screen
- Bind audio sources to entites and particle systems
- low poly looking terrain
